Macleod: a common logic environment for ontology development.

This program consists of a set of scripts designed for key reasoning
tasks frequently encountered in ontology design and verification. At
the moment it focuses on automating tasks that can be accomplished
independent of the semantic of concepts and relations. These tasks are
consistency checking of ontologies and their modules as well as 
checking whether competency questions, providing as ''lemmas'', 
are entailed.

While the program primarily targets first-order ontologies specified 
in the Common Logic (CL) syntax, some parts of it can also be used
for reasoning about ontologies in LADR (Prover9/Mace4) or TPTP syntax
(accepted by many first-order theorem provers and model finders). The
tasks are accomplished by running existing automated theorem provers
and model finders in parallel to establish consistency or inconsistency
of an ontology or a module thereof, or to prove a sentence from an
ontology (or module) or to find a counterexample of the sentence.
Moreover, the tool exploits the modularity of ontologies, which
manifests itself in its file CL imports structure.
